# Cheat list

* Cav esp

    -Icon with name above head (attacking and defending)

* Outline esp

    -Also known as spectator esp. (looks the same as lions old ability)

* Speed hacks

    -Increase speed of player (Run faster, vault faster, repell faster, lay down faster)

* Glow Players and Gadgets

    -Makes rainbow glow of players and gadgets.

* No recoil / no spread

    -No recoil and no spread for the weapon you are currently holding.

* No Flash

    -Player is not blinded by flash bangs

* Damage multiplier

    -Increase the amount of damage dealt per shot. This is done by just having your weapon emmit more bullets

* Shotgun bullets

    -My personal fav. Each shot does x3 amount of destructive damage than bucks shotgun

WARNING: Do not rapid fire, your game will crash with this enabled, use at your own risk!

# Read this if you dont know what to do


Step one, setup a visual studios project.
-If you dont already know how to do this then I suggest you just stop, go read up on visual studios and get comfortable using it.


Step two, finding a RPM/WPM method.
-This project is only the external part of the cheat. The offsets for the cheats are outdated, meaning that you cannot just ctrl+c and ctrl+v and expect it to work. At the very least you are going to need a way to RPM (read process memory) and WPM (write process memory). If you dont know what that means I suggest you read about it here, here or here.


Step three, finishing the functions in MemoryFunctons.h
-Complete the function body for all of the functions inside of MemoryFunction.h


Step four, find offsets.
*1.)
-Download hamachi or any other P2P vpn software. Download here, setup an account/network, have a friend connect.


2.)
-Open the game. Create a local match, and have your freind connect (make sure hes on your hamachi network). I suggest you edit the rounds to be as long as possible and the drone faze the fastest (save you some time)


3.)
-Disable battleye (open task manager -> find battleye services -> disable)


4.)
-Start cheat engine and start finding your offsets! (I'm not going to go into detail about finding specific offsets becuase that is a little out of the scope of this readme).
